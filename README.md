# EmailSender
A Python program that can either send someone the same email a variable amount of times, or send them the bee movie script a variable amount of times 

In order to use the program properly, you must first ensure that less secure apps are able to access your email in order to send via python. You can do this at: https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/lesssecureapps?pli=1&pageId=none , or just google "Allow less secure access apps to access gmail"
You must then configure the program with the email you want to send from, the email you want to send to, the subject, and the body. 
Then call the function in python (function1 is normal, function2 is the bee movie script) with the number of emailsas an argument 

EG calling function1(10) will send 10 emails to the specified email adress inside the program, with the specified subject, body, and send from the specified adress.
